                                <p>Cudera's mission is to create a simple global financial infrastructure that empowers
                                    billions of people around the world. It's powered by blockchain technology and the
                                    plan is to launch it in 2020. Novi is a newly formed Facebook subsidiary whose goal
                                    is to provide financial services that will enable people to access and participate
                                    in the Libra network. Our first product will be a digital wallet for Libra, a new
                                    global currency powered by blockchain technology, and it will be available in 2020
                                    in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. Our vision is to reinvent money and
                                    transform the global economy so people everywhere can live better lives. Novi will
                                    let you send Libra to almost anyone with a smartphone, as easily and instantly as
                                    you might send a text message or photo, and at low to no cost. And, in time, we plan
                                    to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with
                                    the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your
                                    local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.</p>
